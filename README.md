In this section, AB Test and Bidding Methods Conversion will be compared

<hr />

### Business Problem

ðŸ“Œ Facebook recently introduced a new bidding type, 'average bidding', as an alternative to the existing bidding type called 'maximum bidding'. One of our customers, test.com, decided to test this new feature and would like to do an A/B test to see if average bidding converts more than maximum bidding.
The A/B test has been going on for 1 month and test.com is now waiting for you to analyze the results of this A/B test. The ultimate success criterion for test.com is Purchase. Therefore, the focus should be on the Purchase metric for statistical testing.
